	<h3><b><u>GET INTO FOOTBALL</u></b></h3>
	<p>	Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football 
		that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football 
		(specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football. 
		These various forms of football are known as football codes.</p><br>
	<h3><b><u>THE HISTORY OF FOOTBALL</u></b></h3>
	<p>	Football (or soccer as the game is called in some parts of the world) has a long history. Football in its current form arose in England in the middle of the 19th century. 
		But alternative versions of the game existed much earlier and are a part of the football history.The first known examples of a team game involving a ball, which was made out of a rock, 
		occurred in old Mesoamerican 
		cultures for over 3,000 years ago. According to the sources, the ball would symbolize the sun and the captain of the losing team would be sacrificed to the gods.The first known ball 
		game which also involved kicking took place In China in the 3rd and 2nd century BC under the name Cuju. Cuju was played with a round ball on an area of a square. It later spread to 
		Japan and was practiced under ceremonial forms.Other earlier variety of ball games had been known from Ancient Greece. The ball was made by shreds of leather filled with hair 
		(the first documents of balls filled with air are from the 7th century). In the Ancient Rome, games with balls were not included in the entertainment on the big arenas, but could occur 
		in exercises in the military. It was the Roman culture that would bring football to the British island (Britannica). It is, however, uncertain in which degree the British people were influenced 
		by this variety and in which degree they had developed their own variants.</p><br>
	<h3><b><u>FIFA</u></b></h3>
	<p>	FIFA was founded in 1904 to oversee international competition among the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. Headquartered 
		in Zürich, its membership now comprises 211 national associations. Member countries must each also be members of one of the six regional confederations into which the world is divided: Africa, Asia, 
		Europe, North & Central America and the Caribbean, Oceania, and South America.Today, FIFA outlines a number of objectives in the organizational Statues, including growing football internationally, 
		providing efforts to ensure football is accessible to everyone, and advocating for integrity and fair play. FIFA is responsible for the organization and promotion of football's major international 
		tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991. Although FIFA does not solely set the rules of football, that being the responsibility 
		of the International Football Association Board of which FIFA is a member, it applies and enforces the rules across all FIFA competitions. All FIFA tournaments generate revenue from sponsorship; 
		in 2018, FIFA had revenues of over US $4.6 billion, ending the 2015–2018 cycle with a net positive of US$1.2 billion, and had cash reserves of over US$2.7 billion. </p>
